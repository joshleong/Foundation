# apps/rune — Foundation's board, drawn by Rune

A second renderer for the board, beside the web renderer and never instead of it.
[Rune](https://github.com/anomalyco/rune) is a Rust GPU UI framework with its own layout, text,
springs and renderer. This crate draws Foundation's grid with it, builds to wasm, and runs on a
canvas through WebGPU in the browser and in the desktop app's webview.

It is off by default. **Settings → Renderer** turns it on for this device and lists, row by row,
what Rune draws the same as the web renderer, what differs, and what isn't there yet
(`apps/client/src/rune/parity.ts`). SPEC §3 and §7 say where it stands.

## Build

```sh
npm run rune:build            # release -> apps/client/public/rune/ (not checked in)
npm run rune:build -- --dev   # quicker to build, about twice the size
```

Needs rustup (`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain Rune pins, with the wasm target) and the
wasm-bindgen CLI at the version in `Cargo.toml`:

```sh
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.129 --locked
```

The first build compiles Rune and wgpu (about three minutes here); after that an edit rebuilds
in about twenty seconds. Without a build the app says so and stays on the web renderer.

## How it fits

```
store.ts (the board, its geometry) ──▶ rune/scene.ts ──JSON──▶ scene.rs ──▶ view.rs ──▶ WebGPU canvas
        ▲                                                                      │
        └──────────── rune/host.ts ◀──JSON── bridge.rs (press, move, text) ◀───┘
camera.ts (one camera, both engines) ──▶ setCamera ──▶ two Live values (no view re-run)
```

- **The store is the one writer.** Rune never changes the board: it reports what the person
  did (`bridge.rs`) and `apps/client/src/rune/host.ts` calls the store's own actions. Sync,
  viewers, undo and the server's invariants don't know Rune exists.
- **The store is the one source of geometry.** `scene.ts` hands over sections and cards already
  laid out by the functions the web renderer, the wires and the cursors read, and colours
  already resolved from `packages/ui/src/tokens.css`. If the two engines disagree about where
  something is, one of them has a bug. `SCENE_VERSION` (both sides) guards the shape.
- **One camera.** The grid's springs, wheel, pinch, throw, framing and keys are the same code
  for both engines (`GridViewport.tsx`); it asks `hitWorld` what's under the pointer where the
  web renderer asks the DOM.
- **Web layers stay web.** Wires, cursors and the chrome draw over the canvas.
- **Web content stays web, as islands.** Apps, pages, machines, maps and video are the web
  renderer's own components, placed over the canvas in a shell of their section
  (`apps/client/src/rune/RuneIslands.tsx`). `isIsland` in `scene.ts` is the one rule: a card is
  drawn by exactly one engine, and Rune is never handed an island. A table is Rune's at rest
  and an island while it's the card in hand.

- **The client decides, Rune draws.** What a section's toolbar or a card's bar offers, and what
  each button does, is `apps/client/src/rune/tools.ts` (the web toolbar's own list). Rune is
  handed `{ id, icon, tone }`, draws the icon (`view.rs` `icon`) and reports the id.
- **Right-clicks are claimed.** Rune's web layer hands a right-click to the browser unless an
  element has `on_secondary_press`; the board's root has one, so the browser's menu never opens
  over it, and a section's reports the point for the client to open the menu at.

## Adding a part

1. Put what it needs in the scene (`scene.ts` and `scene.rs`, and bump `SCENE_VERSION` in both).
2. Draw it in `view.rs` with the web renderer's own values (name where each comes from).
3. Report any new interaction through `bridge.rs` and handle it in `host.ts` with a store action.
4. Check it beside the web renderer (`e2e/rune.spec.ts` takes both engines' pictures of one
   board), then move its row in `parity.ts`. A row turns to *Same* only after that.

## Rune itself

Pre-release: `Cargo.toml` pins a rev of Rune's `dev` branch, and the same rev for the four
crates Rune patches (bump all five together). Rune's docs are `crates/rune/README.md` and
`WEB.md` in its repo. Found here, 2026-11-12: a web canvas asked to be transparent came out
opaque (so Rune paints the paper), and the web host sets no cursors. Rune takes issues, not
pull requests.
