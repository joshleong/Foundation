/**
 * The server's sockets — board sync (/sync/:board), huddles
 * (/huddle/:board/:id) and a machine's shared terminal
 * (/machines/:board/:panel/tty) — and how a socket proves who opens it.
 *
 * A browser on the server's own site sends its session cookie with the
 * upgrade, and a program (an agent, a test) can send an Authorization header.
 * A browser can't put a header on a WebSocket, though, and the desktop app
 * talking to a hosted server holds a bearer, not a cookie (the cookie is
 * SameSite and the app's page is another site). So, like T3's
 * websocket-ticket, it first asks `POST /api/ws-ticket { path }` with its
 * bearer and opens `path?ticket=…`. A ticket:
 *
 *  - is not the session: 32 random bytes, only its sha256 kept;
 *  - lives 30 seconds and is deleted as it is read (one socket, once);
 *  - opens only the socket path it was issued for (that kind, that board,
 *    that huddle or machine), and only if its session is still live;
 *  - is never read by an HTTP route, so it can't stand in for the session.
 *
 * What the socket may then do is decided as for any other: a viewer's sync
 * socket is read-only, a viewer watches a terminal.
