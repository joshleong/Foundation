/**
 * A T3 thread as someone on the board: a person asks one of this computer's
 * agents (Claude, Codex, Kimi, DeepSeek, …) for something in a section, and
 * that agent joins the section's group under its own name, like any of the
 * crew, for as long as its thread works (crew.ts gives it the presence; the
 * section's tab and the agents pane draw it).
 *
 * The thread runs in Foundation's own T3 (t3host.ts), supervised, in a folder
 * of its board (`<data>/t3-work/<board>`). It runs a model on someone's plan
 * or key, so it starts only from a person's press (index.ts: requirePerson
 * and a writer of the board).
 *
 * The board's tools: each ask gets a folder of its own
 * (`<data>/t3-work/<board>/<ask>`) holding a tool file that points the agent
 * at Foundation's tool server as this ask's crew member, for this person and
 * this board, with a session of its own that ends when the thread does. The
 * agent's launch line names that file (t3host.ts: BOARD_TOOL_ARGS), so a
 * Claude-driven agent (Claude, Kimi, DeepSeek) reads the board, makes cards
 * in the section it stands in under its own name, and aims its cursor like
 * any of the crew. An agent of another kind (Codex), or one whose launch line
 * a person changed, works in its folder only, and its brief says so.
