/**
 * The "script" runtime: a fixed playbook through the real board tools, with
 * no model. For tests and the browser checks only (FOUNDATION_AGENT_SCRIPT=1),
 * so the crew can be checked end to end (names, cursors, aim-then-act,
 * helpers, bring_view, attribution) without a subscription or credits, and
 * the same way every time. It never runs in a real deployment.
 *
 * The lead's playbook, for an ask like “make a section called “Supply” with
 * the parts and hook up FactoryForm, and get help”:
 *   plan → read the board → section → table of parts → (connector) →
 *   (a helper writes a note) → a note → arrange → bring the person there.
 * A helper reads what its crew has made (crew_work: the lead's plan, each
 * agent's cards) and writes one note in the section it was given: the
 * supplier list, or, when a teammate already wrote that, only the lead times.
 * "…get two helpers" calls in a second one, after the first has written.
