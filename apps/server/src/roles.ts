/**
 * Who may change a board. Everyone signed in can read; a viewer can't write.
 *
 * A person's role on a board is the one an admin set for that board, or else
 * their account's role: admin, member, or viewer (a flowform viewer let in
 * with FLOWFORM_ADMIT_VIEWERS). Admins can always write, and only admins set
 * roles.
 *
 * The server enforces it everywhere a write can come from: the board's sync
 * socket drops a viewer's updates (attachConnection), runTool refuses every
 * tool but the read-only ones (HTTP tools, MCP, the agent), and the HTTP gate
 * refuses a viewer's other writes. The client's view-only mode is a courtesy
 * on top.
