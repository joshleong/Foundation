/**
 * A web page space's canvas: the page at its address, filling the paper the
 * floor leaves (under the top bar, between the panes, above the bottom bar).
 * The space still has its board underneath, for its people and activity; the
 * grid just isn't what you look at.
 *
 * The page runs in the same sandbox as an app on a card (frameSandbox.ts):
 * a page from elsewhere keeps its own origin and can't reach the board.
