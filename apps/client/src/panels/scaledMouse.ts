/**
 * Mouse events for a widget that measures in its own unscaled pixels (xterm),
 * drawn inside the board's scaled world (camera zoom × the section's fit).
 * xterm turns clientX/Y into a cell with getBoundingClientRect (scaled) and its
 * cell size (unscaled), so at 50 % a drag selected from the wrong place: twice
 * as far from the corner as the pointer (#53). Here each mouse event bound for
 * the widget is caught on its way down and sent on with the pointer's place
 * expressed in the widget's own pixels, which is what xterm assumes.
 *
 * mousedown, click and dblclick inside the widget; mousemove and mouseup on
 * the whole page while a press that began inside is held (xterm follows a
 * selection drag on the document). Typing, wheel and touch are untouched.
