/**
 * The parity ledger: every part of the board the web renderer draws or does,

 * → Renderer shows it, and a row only turns to "same" when it has been
 * checked side by side (docs/evidence).
 *
 * - same:    drawn and behaves as the web renderer does
 * - partial: there, with a named difference
 * - web:     still the web layer's, drawn over Rune's canvas (it works, it just isn't Rune's yet)
 * - missing: not available while Rune is on
