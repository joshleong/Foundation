//! Foundation's desktop shell.
//!
//! In `tauri dev` the window shows the Vite dev server (:1430), which proxies the
//! Foundation server, so everything is same-origin.
//!
//! Packaged, the window is served by the app itself from http://localhost:31440
//! (tauri-plugin-localhost) instead of Tauri's own scheme (http://tauri.localhost
//! on Windows, tauri://localhost on macOS). Cookies are matched by host, not port,
//! so a Foundation server on http://localhost:4410 is the same site: its
//! SameSite=Lax session cookie, the sync WebSocket and SSE all reach it, and its
//! CORS already admits http://localhost:<port>. The bundled client still opens when
//! the server is down, so the device's board copies keep working offline.
