# Foundation

The company brain of Form Industries. It is one shared grid where people, the apps we build, and the agents that work with us meet.

- **The grid:** sections hold tables, maps, notes and media, plus live panels: running apps (with their GitHub repo, MCP tools and input/output ports), web pages, machines, uploaded files and CAD, live company systems, agent jobs, and asks to teammates.
- **The agent layer:** sits above the grid and shows how apps are wired, where agents are working, and what everyone just did.
- **The agent:** runs the whole interface. It runs on your Claude Code subscription or on API credits. It can organize the board, open and wire apps, find repos, read BomForm and FactoryForm, brief Vision, chase people for CAD (Hermes), and queue reverse-engineering (REA).
- **The company board:** shows Vision, BomForm, FactoryForm, the Data Room, Creation and Foundation live, wired by how data actually flows between them.

**[SPEC.md](SPEC.md)** is the plan, with status, the hookups you need to do, known issues and phases. **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** is the design language. Inside the app, `#/design` renders it live.

## Run it locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev            # server :4410 + client :1430 → open http://localhost:1430
```

Sign in with **Continue with Google**, the same Google sign-in as the flowform client, through flowform-server (`FLOWFORM_URL`, default https://server.formresearch.ai), or with your name and an allowlisted email (dev login). To configure Slack, BomForm, API credits and more, copy `.env.example` to `.env`; see SPEC §6.

```sh
npm test               # server invariants (node:test)
npm run typecheck      # every workspace
npm run desktop        # the server + the desktop window (needs Rust; see below)
```

### On Windows

1. Install **Node 22.13 or newer** (nodejs.org, LTS) and **Git for Windows**.
2. Clone and run, in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/joshleong/Foundation.git
   cd Foundation
   copy .env.example .env
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:1430. Sign in with Google, or with your name and an allowlisted email (`.env` sets `FOUNDATION_ALLOWLIST`). Every ⌘ shortcut is Ctrl on Windows.
3. **The desktop window** also needs the Tauri toolchain: **Visual Studio Build Tools** with the *Desktop development with C++* workload, **Rust** from rustup.rs (the default MSVC toolchain), and **WebView2** (already on Windows 10 and 11). Then `npm run desktop`. The first build compiles the Rust side, which takes a few minutes.
4. **The agent** runs on Claude Code: install it with Anthropic's native Windows installer so `claude.exe` is on your PATH (an npm-installed `claude.cmd` can't be started without a shell; point `FOUNDATION_CLAUDE_CLI` at a `claude.exe` instead), or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for the API runtime.

Vision Code hand-offs look for Vision on macOS paths, and the reverse-engineering job starts `npx` directly, so neither starts on Windows yet (SPEC §7).

Connect Claude Code (or Codex) to a board: press **⌘K**, choose **Connect Claude Code**, and paste the command it copies.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **⌘K** | Search everything, paste a link to open it as a live app, or run an action |
| **⌘J** | The agent (🎙 to talk) |
| **A** | Agent layer |
| **P** | Present |
| **⌘U** | Upload |
| **Esc** | Release an app and step up the grid |

On the grid itself:
- Drag empty space to pan; Ctrl + scroll to zoom.
- Drag a card header to float it.
- Drag from an output port to wire it.

## Layout

```
apps/client       React 19 + Vite grid and shell (Tauri desktop in src-tauri)
apps/server       Node 22 + TypeScript: SQLite, Yjs sync, auth, files, search, MCP, agent, connectors
packages/protocol the board schema every side shares
packages/ui       design tokens, springs and the night engine
```

Foundation also takes in the work of `flowform-client` and `flowform-server` (see SPEC §3.1). The Gantt and digital-twin features were dropped.
